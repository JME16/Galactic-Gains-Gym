This project started as Super Hero Gym (hence departments start as SHG) and then changed to Galactic Gains Gym when I decided to employ Star Wars and Dragon Ball characters.
My goal is to demonstrate my Linux admin skills with directories, files, privileges and other paperwork associated with each department.

I am open to suggestions and comments for improvements.

Thank you for taking the time to stop by and view!
